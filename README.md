# Priority-Queue-Implementation
Implementation of a priority queue using an ArrayList as underlying data structure.

This is a min-heap implementation of a priority queue:
>>Meaning: at each level of the heap, the value in a node is less than all values in its two subtrees.

This generic custom priority queue implements the queue interfce.
I have provided code for all the methods defined in the Queue Interface except for those inherited from the Collection Interface.
